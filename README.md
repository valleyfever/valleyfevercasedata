## About

We compiled a coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) case database for the southwestern United States (US). Currently, county-level, monthly case counts are available from 2000-2015 for Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. We collected these data from each respective state health agency. This database may be used to examine relationships between the number of valley fever cases and any hypothesized explanatory variable, including environmental conditions, human activities, or other health effects. We aim to keep this database current and expand this database as more states begin valley fever surveillance programs.

## Overview

### VFCD consists of:

#### 1) Database

Comma-separated values (CSV) monthly data from 2000-2015 for Arizona, California, and Nevada.

To share data, please submit a pull request. Alternatively, email Morgan Gorris at mgorris@uci.edu to share data or become a GitHub contributing member. 

#### 2) Manuscript

There are multiple considerations to take when analyzing valley fever case data.
The manuscript (fxm add link) describes the methods of collection, quality control, and limitations of the data.
A paper that employs this dataset has been submitted to Open Health Data:

#### 3) Supporting software

None yet. Stay tuned.
